    <div>
        <p>As a Senior in XA, I've had numerous classes that make use of HTML and CSS, as well as other web dev tools like Figma
        and Adobe. I also had multiple years of practice with JavaScript back in High School, though I've forgotten much of it.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>In this class I'm just looking to get some more familiarity with HTML and CSS, learn some neat tricks, and 
        to hopefully boost my skills a bit beyond just beginner-level.</p>
